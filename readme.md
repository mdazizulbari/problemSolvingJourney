# Problem Solving Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my journey in competitive programming and problem-solving. Started from absolute basics in C language, building up skills little by little. This repo tracks progress through lessons, random problems from various online judges, and contest participations.

## About Me
- **Starting Point**: Zero knowledge in programming.
- **Language**: Primarily C, with some transitions to C++ for advanced problems.
- **Goal**: Master problem-solving, understand algorithms, and push toward creating intelligent systems (inspired by visionaries like Dr. Will Caster).

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Lessons** üìö
Focused on structured learning from CPS Academy modules. Covers fundamentals like data types, operators, conditionals, loops, and more.

  - Template file: `0000_template.c` (Basic code skeleton for quick starts).
  - Sub-modules (each with practice problems and codes):
    - 08_introToDataTypes,variables,andOperators
    - 09_practiceToDataTypes,variables,andOperators
    - 10_practiceToDataTypes,variables,andOperators
    - 11_modulesOperator,numberSystems
    - 12_allOparators
    - 13_bitwiseOperator
    - 14&15_conditionalStatements
    - 16_howToThinkOfTheScenario,notTheTestCase
    - 17_introductionToLoop
    - 18_loopPractice
    - 19_nestedLoops
    - 20_loopPractice

- **2.module_cppSTL**
  - Introductory file: `01.cpp` (Basics of C++ Standard Template Library).

### 2. **Random Problems** üîÄ
Solutions to assorted problems from different platforms. Mostly small, foundational challenges to build logic and coding speed.

  - `0003_A-Power.c`: Calculates powers or exponents.
  - `0004_a_laylandNumber.c`: Leyland number computations.
  - `A_Long_Loong.c`: String manipulation.
  - `A_Not_Too_Hard.c`: Basic arithmetic.
  - `B_Glass_and_Mug.c`: Logic for pouring or measurement problems.

- **CodeChef** (36 problems)
  - Numbered: `0001_offByOne.c` (Checks if numbers differ by 1), `0002_2000.c`, `0003_moneyMaking.c`, `0004_sweetsShop.c`, `0005_devouringDonuts.c`, `0006_thalaForAReason.c`, `0007_Oneful_Pairs.c`, `0008_Puzzle_Hunt.c`.
  - Others: `404_Not_Found.c`, `Ageing.c` (Age calculations), `Air_Quality_Index.c`, `Airlines.c`, `All_New_CodeChef.c`, `Candy_Division.c`, `Chef_and_Donation.c`, `Chess_Pairing.c`, `Cricket_World_Cup_Qualifier.c`, `Dice_Number.c`, `Donation_Drive.c`, `Exams.c`, `Fair_Share_Settlement.c`, `Hattrick.c`, `IPL_Ticket_Rush.c`, `Minimum_Wage.c`, `October_Marathon.c`, `Pending_Assignments.c`, `Pizza_Cutting.c`, `Right_There.c`, `Rivalry.c`, `Selling_Insurance.c`, `Sports_Section.c`, `Sunday_Brunch.c`, `Sunny_Day.c`, `Survival_Time.c`, `Water_Park.c`, `Worth_of_a_Video.c`.
  - Themes: Math, conditionals, loops‚Äîbuilding core skills.

- **CodeForces** (4 problems)
  - `A_Division.c`: Division checks.
  - `A_Sum_of_Round_Numbers.c`: Sums with rounding.
  - `B_Same_Parity_Summands.c`: Parity-based sums.
  - `B_Ten_Words_of_Wisdom.c`: String processing for word counts.

### 3. **Contests** üèÜ
Participations in live contests, focusing on CodeForces.

- **CodeForces**
  - `0001.Educational Codeforces Round 182 (Rated for Div. 2)`
    - `A.cpp`: Solution to problem A (basic implementation).
    - `link.md`: Contest link.
  - `0002.`
    - `A.cpp`: Solution in progress.

### 4. **.vscode** ‚öôÔ∏è
Configuration files for VS Code setup:
- `settings.json`
- `tasks.json` (Build and run tasks for C/C++).

## Progression Timeline
- **Early (Modules 8-13)**: Mastered basics‚Äîdata types, operators, bitwise.
- **Mid (Modules 14-20)**: Conditionals, loops, nested structures; solved ~20 random problems.
- **Advanced**: Contests, C++ STL; total ~50+ problems, evolving toward algorithmic thinking.

## How to Use
- Clone: `git clone https://github.com/mdazizulbari/problemSolvingJourney.git`
- Compile C files: `gcc file.c -o output`
- Run: `./output`

## Future Plans
- Add more contests.
- Explore algorithms (sorting, searching).
- Switch to C++ fully for efficiency.
- Contribute to open-source AI projects.
